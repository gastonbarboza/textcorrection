This is a simple Streamlit app that uses the Deepl Python library to take a German text written by a user, translate it back into the user's native language, and then translate it again into German. 

The idea behind it is that the user's grammatical mistakes are caused by imposing their original language's grammar on the foreign language, so translating it into the user's language recovers the meaning, while translating it back into German leaves a gramatically correct result.

This may cause loss of gender in pronouns: ihn/sie and ihm/ihr may be replaced with es/ihm.
